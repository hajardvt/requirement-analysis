# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

## 📝 About the Project  
The **Requirement Analysis Project** focuses on crafting a foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. It simulates a real-world scenario for a **Booking Management System**, ensuring clarity, precision, and structure to set the stage for successful project execution.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?  
Requirement Analysis is the process of **identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting user and system needs** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  

- It defines **what the system should do** and **how it should behave**.  
- Serves as a bridge between stakeholders, business analysts, and developers.  
- Ensures the system is aligned with **user expectations** and **business goals**.  

---

## 🌟 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  
1. **Clarity & Alignment** – Ensures all stakeholders share the same vision of the system.  
2. **Reduces Errors & Costs** – Early detection of issues prevents costly redesigns later.  
3. **Foundation for Development** – Provides a structured blueprint that guides design, coding, and testing.

## 🔑 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  
- **Requirement Gathering** – Collecting needs from stakeholders, users, and documents.  
- **Requirement Elicitation** – Conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops to refine needs.  
- **Requirement Documentation** – Writing detailed requirements in structured documents.  
- **Requirement Analysis & Modeling** – Breaking down requirements into models (diagrams, workflows).  
- **Requirement Validation** – Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy.

## 📂 Types of Requirements  

### Functional Requirements  
Define **what the system should do**.  
Examples for a booking system:  
- Users can search for available rooms.  
- The system must allow customers to book and cancel reservations.  
- Admins can manage properties and pricing.  

### Non-functional Requirements  
Define **system qualities and constraints**.  
Examples:  
- The system should handle 500+ concurrent bookings.  
- Response time must be under 2 seconds.  
- The platform must support web and mobile devices.

## 🎭 Use Case Diagrams  
Use Case Diagrams illustrate the **interactions between users (actors) and the system**.  
They are helpful to visualize:  
- User roles  
- System functionalities  
- Boundaries between actors and system  

### Example – Booking Management System  

Actors:  
- Guest  
- Registered User  
- Admin  

Use Cases:  
- Search rooms  
- Make booking  
- Cancel booking  
- Manage property  
- Checkout & payment

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria  

**Definition**: Acceptance Criteria are **predefined conditions** that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They ensure the feature is working as intended.  

**Importance**:  
- Provides clarity for developers and testers.  
- Defines boundaries for “done.”  
- Prevents scope creep by setting clear limits.  

**Example (Checkout Feature)**:  
- User must be able to select a room and dates.  
- System must calculate total price automatically.  
- Payment must be processed securely.  
- Confirmation email must be sent after successful booking.
